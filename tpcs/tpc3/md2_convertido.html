<h1>Enterprise Operations Manual</h1>
This manual defines standard operating procedures for Enterprise Systems.
It is intended to produce <em>consistent results</em> and <strong>shared habits</strong> across shifts.
Inline identifiers such as incident#771, ticket#8080, and tags like #ops or #sev1 appear as normal text.

<h2>What This Manual Covers</h2>
This manual focuses on routine operations, incident response, and change management.
It does not attempt to replace <em>good judgment</em>; it supports it with <strong>defaults</strong>.

<ul>
 <li>Daily monitoring and hygiene</li>
 <li>Incident declaration and coordination</li>
 <li>Change planning and execution</li>
 <li>Post-incident review and follow-up</li>
</ul>

<h1>Daily Operations</h1>
Daily operations emphasize <em>steady cadence</em> and <strong>low drama</strong>.
If you see expressions like 9*9=81 or patterns like logs*2024, treat the asterisks literally.

<h2>Morning Checks</h2>
Start the day by confirming system health and the overnight pipeline.

<ol>
 <li>Review dashboards and error budgets</li>
 <li>Confirm backups completed successfully</li>
 <li>Check batch job summaries</li>
 <li>Scan support queue for <strong>urgent</strong> items</li>
 <li>Note <em>trends</em> that may become incidents</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ticket Triage</h2>
Triage aims to keep the queue moving with <strong>clear</strong> ownership.

<ul>
 <li>Identify the customer impact</li>
 <li>Ask for missing context <em>early</em></li>
 <li>Route to the right team quickly</li>
 <li>Document the next step in <strong>one</strong> sentence</li>
</ul>

<h1>Change Management</h1>
Changes are safe when they are <em>small</em>, <strong>reviewed</strong>, and reversible.

<h2>Standard Change Steps</h2>
Use the same sequence every time.

<ol>
 <li>Create a change request with <strong>clear scope</strong></li>
 <li>Assess risk and blast radius</li>
 <li>Schedule within an approved window</li>
 <li>Notify stakeholders in advance</li>
 <li>Execute and monitor</li>
 <li>Record <em>outcomes</em> and decisions</li>
</ol>

<h2>What Is Not a List</h2>
References like version 3.2, section 5.1, or item 4.2 appear in text and are not ordered lists.
Formats like 1.ThisHasNoSpace should remain literal.

<h1>Incident Handling</h1>
Incidents are managed through a predictable loop: Assess - Act - Review.
Hyphens here are separators, not list markers.

<h2>Classification</h2>
Use severity levels to drive urgency and communication.

<ul>
 <li>Severity 1: critical outage affecting many users</li>
 <li>Severity 2: major degradation or partial outage</li>
 <li>Severity 3: limited impact with workarounds</li>
 <li>Severity 4: informational or monitoring-only</li>
</ul>

<h2>Response Steps</h2>
When an incident is detected, follow these steps.

<ol>
 <li>Declare the incident and assign a lead</li>
 <li>Establish a communication channel</li>
 <li>Gather facts and assess impact</li>
 <li>Mitigate user-facing symptoms</li>
 <li>Investigate underlying causes</li>
 <li>Decide on <em>next actions</em> and <strong>owners</strong></li>
</ol>

<h1>Communication</h1>
Communication should be <em>plain</em>, <strong>frequent</strong>, and factual.
Avoid speculation; say what you know and what you are doing.

<h2>Update Template</h2>
A good update includes the essentials.

<ul>
 <li>Current status and impact</li>
 <li>What we tried and what happened</li>
 <li>The next step and when we expect results</li>
 <li>Who is doing what, with <strong>names</strong> and timestamps</li>
</ul>

<h1>Post-Incident Review</h1>
Reviews turn pain into learning.
The goal is <em>less repeat pain</em> and <strong>better defaults</strong>.

<h2>Review Agenda</h2>
Keep the agenda short and consistent.

<ol>
 <li>Timeline recap</li>
 <li>Contributing factors</li>
 <li>What went well</li>
 <li>What didn’t go well</li>
 <li>Remediation items with <strong>owners</strong></li>
 <li>Follow-up date and <em>tracking</em> link</li>
</ol>

<h1>Access and Compliance</h1>
Access is granted to enable work, not convenience.
Follow least privilege with <strong>auditable</strong> trails.

<ul>
 <li>Grant access based on role</li>
 <li>Review access quarterly</li>
 <li>Remove access promptly on offboarding</li>
 <li>Audit changes for <strong>compliance</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Final Remarks</h1>
Operations work is invisible when done well.
Consistency, discipline, and <em>attention</em> to detail create <strong>trust</strong>.

<ul>
 <li>Final bullet to ensure unordered list handling works correctly</li>
 <li>Final bullet: wildcards like *.log and report*final should remain literal</li>
</ul>
